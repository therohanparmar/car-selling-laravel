# Car Selling Website  
<p align="justify">
This project is a fully functional **Car Selling Website** designed to provide a seamless platform for buying and selling cars. Users can browse a wide range of vehicles with advanced filtering options like make, model, release year, price, and car type, and view detailed pages featuring images, descriptions, and features. Buyers can contact sellers directly, while sellers can easily sign up or log in via email or social accounts (Google/Facebook) to list their cars, upload images, and publish ads. The project emphasizes fundamental web development concepts and delivers a practical, user-friendly solution for car trading.
